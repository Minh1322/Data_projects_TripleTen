## Zuber Project

## Introduction
I'm working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. 
My task is to find patterns in the available information. I want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

Working with a database, I will analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

## Description

 For these two datasets you now need to

- import the files
- study the data they contain
- make sure the data types are correct
- identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs
- make graphs: taxi companies and number of rides, top 10 neighborhoods by number of dropoffs
- draw conclusions based on each graph and explain the results

Testing hypotheses (Python)

Test the hypothesis:

"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."

Decide where to set the significance level (alpha) on your own.

Explain:

- how you formed the null and alternative hypotheses
- what criterion you used to test the hypotheses and why

## Conclusion
- We can see that there are no missing values or duplicates.
- The column data types are also valid and don't need to be changed.
- We found that the Loop, River North, and Streeterville neighborhoods have the most amount of trips in the Chicago area.
- The number of trips for 2 days are mostly in the range of 0-2500 trips.
- Flash Cab was the most popular taxi company followed by Taxi Affiliation Services and Medallion Leasing. 
- We find that we can reject null hypothesis which means we can say that the average duration of rides does change on rainy Saturdays.
