    "- For exploratory data analysis, I analyze the data to figure out what story the data is telling and how to effectively extract the right information needed for model training. This is important for the next step where I prepare the features for model training, so that the model can perform the best.\n",
    "- During the build models phase, I tested a group of different models with different hyperparameters using GridSearch to find the model that has the highest scoring for our needs. \n",
    "- Finally, we have to test our best model to see if the model is actually effective and consistent in achieving the results of predicting customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "What difficulties did you encounter and how did you manage to solve them?\n",
    "- Figuring out what features were important for the model training was a challenge because it is important what you choose as it can affect the model performance. \n",
    "- During model training, my AUC-ROC score was not as good as it should've been, so I had to experiment with more hyperparameters and features. \n",
    "\n",
    "What were some of the key steps to solving the task?\n",
    "- Figuring out the correct models and hyperparameters was very important to achieving the results needed for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is your final model and what quality score does it have?\n",
    "- My final model was LightGBM with a ROC-AUC score of 0.861 and an accuracy of 0.897. \n"
